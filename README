This app is a wrapper for Transport For London's routeplanner, designed to save typing by using the GPS and stored favourites.

It'll consult the GPS then grab the routes by screenscraping TfL's site at http://www.tflwap.gov.uk and present them nicely. TfL can't take a lat/lng as a departure place, so it has to use a sqlite database of sample postcodes to translate the GPS reading to a nearby postcode. It then walks through the tflwap forms submitting the right things.

Uses these nice external libraries and helpers:

* http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/10/using-libxml2-for-parsing-and-xpath.html for libxml2 HTML XPath support
* http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/ for GTMHTTPFetcher
* http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/ for regular expressions
* http://flycode.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/fmdb/ for an Objective C wrapper for sqlite
