This app is a wrapper for Transport For London's routeplanner, designed to save typing by using the GPS (and probably some stored favourites).

When it is finished, it'll consult the GPS and then ask you for your destination, then grab the routes by screenscraping TfL's site at http://www.tflwap.gov.uk and present them nicely. TfL can't take a lat/lng as a departure place, so it has to use an API to translate the GPS reading to a postcode. It then walks through the tflwap forms submitting the right things.

So far I'm still sketching. The TfL and Postcoder classes are functional screenscrapers but there's no GUI yet. For some reason the Postcoder only returns results about 75% of the time. I'd love a better lat/lng -> UK Postcode API.

Uses these nice external libraries and helpers:

* http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/10/using-libxml2-for-parsing-and-xpath.html for libxml2 HTML XPath support
* http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/ for GTMHTTPFetcher
* http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/RegexKitLite/ for regular expressions
